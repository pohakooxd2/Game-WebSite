Since this project does not require a backend, for the best experience I suggest using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), cloning the repo into the Apache Server directory at `C:\xampp\htdocs` (for windows) or `/opt/lampp/htdocs` (for linux), setting the port to something like 8080, opening up a browser and going to [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

> **Warning**
> Cloning a repository with Git removes everything in the folder you do it in. If you're not careful, you can delete your hard drive, so please do not do this unless you know what you're doing.
